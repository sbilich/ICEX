/**
* CG OpenGL scene
*
* Description:	Generates a 3D underwater scene. 
*
* * * * * *
* main.cpp:
*	Input: 	Expects to be passed in a string that contains the relative path
*		to the “resources” directory.
*
*	Rendering objects: The draw calls for each shader program are separated into
*			    modular components to allow for easy removal and addition
*			    of objects into and out of the scene. Comment out the
*			    corresponding function calls to add/remove, i.e; to remove
*			    the scenery, comment out the call to drawScenery() in 
*			    drawTexturedObjects().
*
*	Drawing the roadmap (Work In Progress):
